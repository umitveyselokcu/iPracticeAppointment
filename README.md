# iPractice Technical Assignment - Skeleton Project
#### We have created this project to reduce the setup time required for our assignment. If and how it is used is entirely at your discretion.

### Project Structure
This is a simple ASP.Net core API project setup to run using SQLite. There is an initial migration to create and seed the database and two controllers with the required endpoints.

It is entirely acceptable to add remove or rename any of the components of the project.
